# BoostUp (Pose Estimator)

## Overview

This project created in order to examin the TF abilities on the browser using web workers. 

The algorithms being used are CNN based on ResNet50 and KNN.

The outcome is an application that is able to estimate what pose a person found at, and count the amount of repeats during live/recorded exercise.



## Demo

A demo project is found [here](https://boostup-app.herokuapp.com/)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

<<<<<<< HEAD
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

<<<<<<< HEAD
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## MyHomeFit - Web

## Rule
- 코딩을 바로 시작하지 않고, issue를 생성하여 해야할 일을 정리하고 issue번호로 브랜치를 생성한 후(branch명: feat/이슈 번호) 시작한다.
- 절대 main(또는 master)에서 바로 작업하지 않고, issue번호 별로 branch를 생성해서 그 branch에서 작업한다
- merge는 주기적으로 자주 
- commit은 생활화하자 (issue에서 각 항목별로 구현 완료할때마다 체크해주고 commit해주자)
- commit할때는 commit messege convention을 최대한 지켜주자


## commit messege convention
```
- *feat: 새로운 기능 추가*
- *update: 버전 등 업데이트*
- *fix: 수정*
- *fix typo: 오타 수정*
- *bugfix: 버그 수정*
- *docs: 문서 수정*
- *style: 코드 모캣팅, 세미콜론 누락, 코드 변경 없을 경우*
- *refactor: 코드 리펙토링*
- *chore: 빌드 업무 수정, 패키지 수정*
```
- fix, refactor에는 추가적으로 파일명을 써준다. fix(MakeYourSet.js): 스크롤 기능 오류 해결
- 수정한 파일이 많을 경우에는 FileName을 폴더 명 혹은 작업 단위로 대체한다
- commit 메시지가 여러줄일 경우 제목과 내용을 분리시킨다.


## PR convention
- Pull Request 작성 시 제목은 브랜치명과 이슈 제목으로 한다.
    - 예시) feat/2 Make Your Set 페이지 구현
- 내용은 resolve: #{이슈번호}로 한다. (이렇게 하면 Merge시에 자동으로 issue가 해결된 것으로 설정해준다)
